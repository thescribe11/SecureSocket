# A wrapper around TCP for sending encrypted data

I created this for a file backup application I've been working on as a hobby project. As such, the API is designed to work with it, and it only. Perhaps I'll come back at a later date and make it more suitable for general use; perhaps not.

**CAVEAT EMPTOR**:

- This has never been audited for security.
- It probably never will be.
- Seeing as this is a component of a hobby project, I can't guarantee any kind of consistent updates.
- I've only tested it on 64-bit Linux systems.
